Changed from version 1.0 --> 1.1

major changes:
- some refactoring of MpAccessMPI, avoid double allocation of 
	message buffers 
- ObjectStream looses ownership when assignment operator is used 
	to avoid copying of large memory areas that is not needed actualy
- on reapartition of macro grid the order of memory allocation was
	changed which saves a little memory 
- when vectors are used and filled via push_back then first memory is
	reserved, if possible, which leads to some performance enhancment	

minor changes: 
- boundary ids are check on read of macro grid 
- ParallelGridMover can lock and unlock MyAlloc to avoid unnecessary 
	free of memory during load balancing.
- Some reordering of member variables of the element classes which lead
