ALU3d-Grid library
============

Getting started
---------------

To create the normal configure script run 

  ./autogen.sh

For possible options run ./autogen.sh --help  .

To compile the library ALU3d-Grid has to check several components of
your system. Run

  ./configure

to commence those tests. If you intend to use the parallel version of the
grid, make sure that you have MPI and Metis or PARTY and supply the
respective flags to the configure script.

You can use

  ./configure --prefix=PATH

if you don't want ALU3d-Grid to be installed into the working directory.

After configuration

  make
  make install

build and install ALU3d-Grid.

Debug Options
--------------

There are serveral debug options that can be set an shell environment
variable and that forces the code to produce debug output. To use this
feature, the code must be compiled without the CPP variable NDEBUG set. 
The following shell environment variables can be set to a level of 
verbosity (higher is better).

VERBOSE      general verbose output  
VERBOSE_MGB  output produced by the macro grid builder 
VERBOSE_LDB  output produced while partitioning. 
VERBOSE_PLL  output produced by parallel grid methods


Optimisation 
-------------

The ALU3d-Grid code is highly riddled with assert statements. 
Therefore it is recommened to compile the library and the application code
with the CPP variable NDEBUG set (i.e. -DNDEBUG) to avoid all asserts
statement tests.
