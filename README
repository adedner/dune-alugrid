DUNE-library
============

Getting started
---------------

To compile a small library ALU3dGrid has to check several components of
your system. Run

  ./configure

to commence those tests. If you intend to use the parallel version of the
grid, make sure that you have MPI and Metis or PARTY and supply the
respective flags to the configure script.

You can use

  ./configure --prefix=PATH

if you don't want ALU3dGrid to be installed into /usr/local

After configuration

  make
  make install

build and install ALU3dGrid (you may need root-permissions for the install
part depending on the prefix set)
