DUNE-library
============

Getting started
---------------

To compile a small library ALU3d-Grid has to check several components of
your system. Run

  ./configure

to commence those tests. If you intend to use the parallel version of the
grid, make sure that you have MPI and Metis or PARTY and supply the
respective flags to the configure script.

You can use

  ./configure --prefix=PATH

if you don't want ALU3d-Grid to be installed into /usr/local

After configuration

  make
  make install

build and install ALU3d-Grid (you may need root-permissions for the install
part depending on the prefix set)

Debug Options
--------------

There are serveral debug options that can be set an shell environment
variable and that forces the code to produce debug output. To use this
feature, the code must be compiled without the CPP variable NDEBUG set. 
The following variables can be set to a level of verbosity (higher is
better).

VERBOSE      general verbose output  
VERBOSE_MGB  output produced by the macro grid builder 
VERBOSE_LDB  output produced while partitioning. 
VERBOSE_PLL  output produced by parallel grid methods
